# Voluntary Tracker Requirements
******

## Roles

There are two main roles: 

* Trackee (the person who is being tracked) 
* Viewer/Supervisor

## User Stories

These user stories will eventually grow to have acceptance tests attached to them, which will make them less ambiguous. Right now, I am focusing on getting the requirements down on paper. The numbers at the end are IDs that I can use to reference the user stories in this document.

Even at this early stage, I can already feel the unwieldliness of a long list of requirements. I think use cases will be a better fit for me because they organize the requirements into a more easily memorable structure.

+  As a Trackee, I want my supervisors to only see what I was doing while I was "on the clock" (1)

+ As a Trackee, I want to be able to see all my own data. This includes wanting to see what I was doing when I was off the clock. (2)

+ As a Trackee, I want to be able to completely turn off tracking sometimes - so nothing is recorded for anyone to see, including me. (3)

+ As a Trackee, I want it to be much easier to honestly omit data than to falsify data so that I am nudged to stay on the straight and narrow. (4)

+ As a Trackee, I want to be able to be on the clock for different supervisors at different times. For example, I may work on two projects for two different clients (Jim and Anne). I'd like Jim to be able to look at what I was doing for him, but be unaware of what I did for Anne. (5)

 If Jim has someone working for him, I'd like to be able to give that person the same ability to view that Jim has. 

+ As a Trackee, I want my data to be safe from editing by other people. (6)

+ As a Trackee, I want to be able to edit my data to fix mistakes (7)
