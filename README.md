VoluntaryTracker
================

Discover and remember your time usage in a non-intrusive way

Planning
--------

I described but never implemented a system involving a Google App engine API and a python desktop component.

Fogzap
---------------

A simple system providing a command-line interface to fogbugz. Its
original purpose was to aggregate the time tracking you already do
manually using fogbugz and post it on your Facebook wall. However, it
has accreted a few extra features and also includes a fogbugz access
library with different features and a different interface from the
library from fogcreek.
